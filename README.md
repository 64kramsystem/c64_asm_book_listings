# C64 (Commodore 64) ASM Book Listings

Listings from (old) C64 ASM books I've studied on.

Many (if not all) of the books from the past don't have a digital edition, so, while studying them, I'm publishing their listings, in a cleaned, converted (to Kick Assembler) and commented version.

The listings are in the format `$book_name/$chapter.$page.$description.asm`.

## Current books/listings

- Machine Code Games Routines for the Commodore 64 (WIP)
  - 06.047: Spiral screen fill
  - 07.071: Small memory fill

## Errata

The listing presented have been fixed, where I've found bugs. I've published the errata, with explanations, on my [professional blog](https://saveriomiroddi.github.io/tag/retrocomputing/).
